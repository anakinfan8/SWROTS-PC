// The Xbox executable is linked to run at fixed addresses starting at 0x10000.

// starts, so the only reliable way to own that range is to be the image that
// occupies it: this executable is linked at 0x10000 with a large zero-filled
// section (g_GameImage) spanning the whole game image.
//
// The loader then hands control to core.dll, which copies the game into
// this range -- overwriting the loader's own code -- so SwrotsMain never
// returns here. No CRT is linked; keep this file free of library calls.
