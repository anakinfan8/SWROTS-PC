# The versus roster: how Yoda became a fighter

The Xbox release has nine versus fighters. The disc also has Yoda's select-screen head and bust,
his HUD portrait and his name and title in every language, but no slot for him: a fighter that was
planned and left out. The port adds him as a tenth fighter with his own cell, and is built so that
more fighters can be added the same way ([adding versus fighters](../modding/adding-versus-fighters.md)).

This page records what the game does and what the port changes, for anyone continuing the work.
Addresses are the retail Xbox executable's (NTSC-U), as loaded. The code is `src/game/roster.cpp`
(the select screens and the duel), `src/game/versus.cpp` (duel cameras, the `duelist` command),
`src/game/aliases.cpp` (Yoda's blocks), `src/game/characters.cpp` (HUD portraits) and
`src/game/resources.cpp` (loading from other levels, generated textures).

## The pieces

| What | Where it comes from | What the port does |
|---|---|---|
| A cell on the select grid | the menu's `HeadsTextSet` | adds a picture to the menu as it loads |
| Name and title | a table of ten text IDs | answers for extra slots |
| Unlocked | the profile's lock bytes | extra slots are never locked; the profile is untouched |
| Random | `rand() % unlocked count` | chooses among unlocked fighters and the extras |
| The fighter in the duel | a class table of nine | a longer table, built per duel |
| Saber colours | a table of nine slots x two players | a longer copy |
| Intro and win cameras | `cinematics\introcamera\<Name>_*_Cam.cin` | another fighter's (Yoda: Anakin's) |
| The character itself | the arena's PAK | loaded from another level's PAK |
| Player 2 against itself | `<texture>_duel` textures | darkened copies generated at run time |
| Reactions to a duelist | the character class | Yoda's blocks mapped to his own animation |

## The select screen

The versus select screen is `interfc\front_end\xml\select_jedi.xbl_xml`, with the menu handler
"JediList" (factory 0x2D54D0, vtable 0x5D68B8). Everything about a cell is found by its slot
number: 0-8 are the fighters, 9 is Random.

- **Number of cells.** The handler makes as many cells as the menu's `HeadsTextSet` has pictures,
  less one (the last is the "locked" picture). Adding a picture adds a cell.
- **Menu texture sets** (compiled `.xbl_xml`): the strings `textureSet` and the set's name (each a
  u32 length and the text), a u32 count, then per picture the strings `texture`, folder and name,
  and 28 bytes `{0, 0, float width, float height, 0, 0, 0}`. The engine asks for the menu by its
  source name (`select_jedi.xml`); the port edits the PAK's copy as it is read
  (`RegisterResourcePatch`).
- **The sets:**
  - `HeadsTextSet`: fighters 0-8, Random, [extras], Locked.
  - `BustsTextSet`: fighters 0-8, [unused 9, extras], evil Anakin, Random, Locked. The last three
    are found from the end (count-3, count-2, count-1), so inserting before them is safe.
  - `FullBodyTextSet`: player 1's 0-8, player 2's 0-8, Random. Player 2 takes the picture 9 on
    when both chose the same fighter (`mov eax, [edx + eax*4 + 0x24]` at 0x2D4ECE). With extras the
    blocks are `slots + 1` long and that displacement is patched to match.
- **Full-body pictures** (0x2D4DB0, thiscall): the port's hook clears them for extra slots, as for a
  locked fighter, since the disc has none.
- **Locks.** `IsLocked` (0x2D4920) and nine inline checks (`cmp edi, 9 / je <unlocked>` at 0x2D49A8,
  0x2D4A4F, 0x2D4B48, 0x2D4BEF, 0x2D4CD4, 0x2D4DEB and others; the grid's own at 0x2D57A4 with `esi`)
  read the profile's byte at `profile + 0x2A8 + slot`. `je` becomes `jae`, so every slot from Random
  on counts as unlocked and extras never read the profile. The save writes exactly nine lock bytes
  (0x24C4E0), so nothing about extras reaches a save file.
- **Names and titles** (stdcall `(TString* out, slot)`, 0x2C6610 and 0x2C65E0) look up a table of ten
  text IDs (0x7F2F2C, 0x7F2F54). The hooks give extras their IDs (Yoda: `IDS_SHELL_YODA`,
  `IDS_SHELL_JEDI_MASTER`, both on the disc) through the TString constructor 0x222FA0.
- **Random** (0x2D4CF0) calls `rand() % n` (0xA23D0) with the number of unlocked fighters, assuming
  they come first. Both calls (0x2D4CF7, 0x2D4D09) go to the port's chooser instead.
- **The arena screen** (`select_arena.xbl_xml`, 0x2D2240) shows only the two fighters' full-body
  pictures, from a set like the select screen's (player 2's offset at 0x2D23D2). Extras show their
  bust there, a 256x128 picture in a 128x256 frame (the engine repeats the edges of a picture smaller
  than its frame, so the bust keeps its own size).

## The duel

- **Which fighters.** The shell writes the chosen class names into the launch settings
  (`[0x7F33FC] + 4` and `+ 8`, `char*`), taking a slot's class from the class table (nine names and
  a null, read by slot at 0x2C6644).
- **Setting up** (0x27D980, thiscall) creates both players' fighters of *every* class in the table,
  keeps the two whose names match the launch names and releases the rest; fighter records are at
  `manager + 0x26C`, indexed by the table's slot. An unknown class name never creates a fighter,
  and the duel crashes later (0x27C460).
- **The port** keeps two longer tables: the select screen's (nine, Random's unused entry, extras) and
  the duel's, built when the duel sets up: the nine plus only the extras chosen. An extra fighter
  is therefore loaded only for a duel it is in, in duel slot 9 and up. Six instructions address the
  duel table (one of them at the table + 4); their displacements are patched to the port's copy.
- **Saber colours**: 0x650C98, three floats per slot and player, all zero for the character's own.
  Player 2 always has an override for the nine; the port's copy gives extras none, except player 2
  in a mirror (see below). The fighter keeps a pointer into the table, so it must stay put.
- **Cameras.** The intro and win shots are `cinematics\introcamera\<Name>_Intro_Cam.cin` and the
  like. The disc has none for Yoda; `versus.cpp` hands him Anakin's (`cameras` in the fighter row).
  An intro animation is `animation\<name>\<name>_intro.bnm`; Yoda has none, so he has no intro yet
  (his bonus mission's cutscene `cinematics\u113\cin_u113_010.cin` is a candidate).

## Loading a character the arena does not have

A duel arena's PAK only holds the nine fighters. When the engine asks for a character the level does
not declare, the port finds it in another level's PAK, declares it the way the engine's folder scan
would, and loads it: the definition (`meshes\chars\common\yoda.xml`), its main script definition
(`s_yoda.xml`), its tables (`r_yoda.csv`, `a_yoda.csv`), model, textures and animations, plus the
animations the engine requires of it (including grapple animations of every fighter it can meet).
For Yoda these come from the Jedi Temple levels. See
[how loading works](../modding/how-loading-works.md#what-the-port-changes).

## Player 2 against itself: Sith Yoda

In a mirror match the game gives player 2 a different look: the duel sets the texture suffix
`_duel` for player 2 (0x27B88D), and the texture resolver (0x14F7E0) uses `<texture>_duel` when the
level declares `d:\<folder>\<name>_duel` (checked through 0x4BDA0). The nine fighters have such
textures (e.g. `meshes\chars\darthvader\vaderhead_duel.stx`); the evil Anakin bust is the select
screen's counterpart.

Yoda has none, so when *both* players chose him the port generates them:

- STX: a 0x184-byte header with the texture's name at 0x40; format 3 is DXT1, 4 is DXT3/5, not
  swizzled. Each colour block's two endpoints are desaturated and darkened (22% brightness, a cold
  tint), keeping the block's DXT1 transparency mode (endpoint order).
- The textures are named `<name>_duel`, written to `cache\disc\` and read from there like loose
  files (textures served from memory decoded but were never drawn), and declared in the duel's level.
- Player 2 gets a red saber in the same case.

Outside a Yoda mirror nothing is generated or declared, so Yoda looks as he always does. The menus
still show his normal bust for player 2: menu pictures are found by name among the textures already
loaded, and loading a generated texture while the menu itself loaded crashed (0x210B6B).

## Reactions: why Yoda floated

Reactions are sequences of the character's script class (GScript, compiled into the executable).
The attacker's table (`r_<attacker>.csv`) names the defender's reaction generically, e.g.
`Block1_React_High_Alt`; the defender's class plays it. Every human class inherits the base class's
sequences, which play Anakin's animations through PlaySequence (0x1F5B20, e.g. `Block1_React_High`
plays `Anakin_BloRe1_Hi`). A class renames them with its **alias list**, vtable slot 6
(thiscall `(animations, sequences)`): it fills a null-terminated array of `"animation\0sequence"`
strings and hands it to 0x1F6460, which adds both halves to the two lists.

Yoda's class (vtable 0x608C10, alias method 0x494190) was written for his bonus mission against
clones: its 41 aliases cover blaster and clone hits, not a saber duelist's blows. Those fall back to
Anakin's animations, which the port loads for him; on Yoda's body they keep Anakin's hip height and
he floats. The port adds 55 aliases, every `Block1_*` and `Block2_*` sequence, to his own block
reaction (`Yoda_BlockRe1`). Mapping hits, grapples, throws and falls to his few hit animations was
tried and looked worse than Anakin's, so those stay as they were. A few reactions can still look off.

## Not done yet
